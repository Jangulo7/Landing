## Objective

The main objective of this project was to create a landing page with a ***dynamically built navigation bar***.
The project is responsive and completely separates structure from design/style and functionality.
It includes a form to add more sections to the landing page.
The navigation bar contains links to the appropriate section in the page when an item is clicked.
There are four sections that have been added to the page and you can add three more to complete seven sections.  This limit of seven was set for easiness in review functionality but can be changed.
An active state for page sections was added and it is used when a new section is added and when a section is in the viewport.
A back to top button was added and it is visible inly when the user is near the bottom of the page.
