                        <p>My goal is promoting the participation of women in science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM). It is important to enhance the use of enabling technology to promote the empowerment of women. Information technology (IT) is key to that end. IT has the potential for making incremental progress in the everyday lives of women.  Narrowing the gender gap in Technology is vital for so many reasons, the most pressing being establishing and sustaining genuine equality and access to opportunity regardless of gender. For AI it’s perhaps even more vital that the future is gender diverse and more and more women are represented in the sector because this technology continues to have an increasing amount of responsibility and influence over daily life. It will be damaging if it reinforces gender bias and inequality rather than becoming a powerful tool in working with us to progress gender equality in Tech and wider society. Moreover, it is also the source for truly disruptive and game changing solutions for world challenges. Therefore, we all need to play our part in promoting STEAM among women.</p>

                        <p>According to The Guardian, Jobs in tech permeate every sector, and many women in UK, from midwives to teachers to actors and career-break mothers, are discovering they don’t need a math or tech background to retrain and reinvent themselves.  Opus Talent Solutions indicates some 40% of people on their 12-week course have an arts or humanities degree, and a quarter have no degree, and ages range from late teens to people in their mid-50s. IT jobs board CW Jobs says since the pandemic, interest in digital careers has risen – more than half of non-tech workers (55%) have considered leapfrogging into the sector since the pandemic, but only 3% of girls and women say a tech career is their first choice, and just 16% ever had it suggested to them as an option – compared with a third of males. The main roles available in tech are programmers, cybersecurity specialists, data analysts and user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) designers.</p>

                        <p>IT is integral to every business process, and IT teams interact with business teams, collaborating in dynamic work environments to transform their companies.  Since in many countries IT is less popular than it used to be in universities, many employers look beyond the disciplines of computer science to recruit into IT roles – science, math, and economics or business qualifications are considered.  Moreover, the fact that IT-related jobs are to be found within almost every organization, they allow great flexibility of career choice.  The best employers recognize the importance of retaining their female staff and encourage women to combine families and work. Since many IT jobs are project based, employers are able to offer many different flexible styles of working. The investment in training staff means that employers are keen to encourage women to keep in touch and return after a career break. Finally, various groups exist to support women in the IT industry, such as BCSWomen which is an online news group that offers career development workshops and networking meetings.</p>

                        <p>For years, the gender gap in software engineering has been a hot-button issue. Companies are working on inclusion efforts, all-women and women-identifying boot camps became more prominent, and the conversation about parity made it into mainstream dialogue. Yet the problem persists. The likelihood of success is higher for those entering college with previous programming experience, which disproportionately affects women. Without a computer science degree, a common option is a software engineering boot camp. According to Pew Research Center, 25% of computer-related jobs in STEM were held by women between 2014 and 2016, and the numbers have been declining over the years. Only 16% of the qualified STEM population are women. It seems like while there are not many women in the STEM workforce, there are even less who are considered to be qualified. Many women working in tech came from boot camps or are self-taught professionals. No matter where you obtained your tech skills, the world needs more women building software.</p>
