                <p>Narrowing the gender gap in Technology is vital for so many reasons, the most pressing being establishing and sustaining genuine equality and access to opportunity regardless of gender. For AI it’s perhaps even more vital that the future is gender diverse and more and more women are represented in the sector because this technology continues to have an increasing amount of responsibility and influence over daily life. It will be damaging if it reinforces gender bias and inequality rather than becoming a powerful tool in working with us to progress gender equality in Tech and wider society.</p>
